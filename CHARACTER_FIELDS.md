## Developer Notes

### Data Structure Compatibility
The enhanced character sheet maintains backward compatibility with existing character data by:
- Providing default values for all new fields
- Gracefully handling undefined/null values in display functions
- Using conditional rendering for optional sections

### Performance Considerations
- Conditional rendering reduces DOM complexity for unused features
- Object.entries() and filtering operations are optimized for small datasets
- CSS grid layouts provide efficient responsive behavior

### Extensibility
The character sheet structure is designed for easy extension:
- New fields can be added to the `createDefaultCharacterSheet()` function
- Display logic is modular and can be enhanced per-tab
- Conditional rendering makes it easy to add optional features

### Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future development:
1. **Interactive Elements**: Editable character sheet fields
2. **Automation**: Automatic modifier calculations
3. **Import/Export**: JSON import/export for character data
4. **Validation**: Data validation for character creation
5. **Templates**: Pre-built character templates by class/race

This enhanced character sheet provides a comprehensive foundation for D&D 5e character management within the BattleMap application.
