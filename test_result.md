# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   current_focus:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    - message: "Z-INDEX CONFLICT FIX TESTING: ✅ Decorative vine borders visible and non-interfering ✅ Character sheet button properly disabled when no token selected ✅ Add Token tool selectable with visual feedback ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Token creation via canvas click not working - tokens not being created or selected automatically. Character sheet functionality cannot be tested without a selected token. Need to investigate token creation workflow or provide alternative method to create/select tokens for character sheet testing."

    - message: "FINAL Z-INDEX CONFLICT FIX ASSESSMENT: ✅ UI STABILITY CONFIRMED - Decorative vine borders working without interference, buttons clickable, no z-index overlay issues detected ❌ CRITICAL BLOCKER FOUND - Token creation workflow completely broken: 1) Create Token button clicks but form doesn't appear 2) Canvas token creation not working 3) Cannot test character sheet content visibility without tokens 4) Previous character sheet functionality tests now invalid due to token creation failure. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must fix token creation before character sheet z-index fix can be verified. Current evidence suggests z-index fix successful but cannot confirm character sheet content visibility."

The conditional rendering {showTokenCreator && (...)} is failing. React state setShowTokenCreator() not triggering re-renders. This is a React 19 state management issue in TokenPanel component. URGENT: Main agent must fix React state management before any character sheet testing can proceed. All character sheet functionality is blocked by this token creation failure."
